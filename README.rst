Python bindings for STRIDE: Protein secondary structure assignment from atomic coordinates

About STRIDE:

STRIDE [1] is a program to recognize secondary structural elements  in
proteins from  their atomic coordinates. It performs the same task as
DSSP by Kabsch and Sander [2] but utilizes both hydrogen bond  energy
and  mainchain  dihedral angles rather than hydrogen bonds alone. It
relies on database-derived recognition parameters with the
crystallographers' secondary structure definitions as a standard-of-
truth. Please see Frishman and Argos [1] for detailed description  of
the algorithm.
